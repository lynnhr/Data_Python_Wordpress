Disappointed with the lake of upgrade experience",,So I was on an iPhone 8 Plus and thought the battery life was poor and Siri was crap and this would improve with the upgrade.

So poor I am half considering android for my next phone.

When the phone came it was actually blue no biggie the wrong color wasn‚Äôt a deal breaker. But when I called Boost to transfer my number from T-Mobile to Boost is where the nightmare began. Day 1 we were told it can take 24 hours for the number port to go through but they normally release numbers over night and should be up and running in the morning. Wake up at 6am the next day still no service  I go to work and then my wife spent the whole 2nd day trying to get it squared away. After spending basically the whole day being transferred from 1 person to the next, being hung up on several time, they finally send a ticket to the teach team and was told it should be good in 24 hours. Day 3 now 24 hours later still no service by this point I am fed up I just want a new number I need a phone for work. We were told it‚Äôs too late for a new number and we have to wait for the number port to go through. My wife being very persistent hangs up and calls again. This time we were told we will now have to pay $12.50 to start a new line to get a new number and it will be credited to our bill. My original phone number is still floating around out there saying pending activation. My wife‚Äôs phone came in the next day she had no problem porting her number from the same account. All phones on our old carrier were paid off years ago the worst part is I had to lose a phone number I have had for 10 plus years. I highly suggest if you decide to buy a phone from boost do not try to ports your number over just get a new number.

Excellent deal.,"Reviewed in the United States on November 8, 2023","I really disliked my previous phone due to the continuous lip (for the camera) incorporated into the entire width of the phone. This caused it to be a vending machine of sorts, pulling change out of my pocket every time I withdrew it. It also ran supremely hot and the battery life declined miserably over time after using it a lot as a hot spot. I've only had this ""top of the line"" iphone for about a week now, but it's already a lot better than my previous phone. I took a chance on Boost Infinite because they use three different towers to collect signals from (tmobile, AT&T, & Dish) which theoretically gives my phone better reception. IT DOES. My previous phone rarely captured 5G signals, and it's much more frequent with Boost. My bosses iphone, which only uses AT&T almost never has 5G when I have 5G. I haven't used the phone as a hot spot yet, so I cannot comment on how hot the phone gets on heavy load, but it's already cooler under normal operation. It's probably not fair to compare battery life of a new phone over a less than two year old phone, but already better than I can remember with the other flagship alternative. I somehow got this iphone 15 Pro Max for $60/mo on amazon. That deal no longer exists and it will be about $6 more under current offerings by Boost Infinite. Comparatively, T-Mobile is offering this phone at an upgrade price of $50/mo....JUST FOR THE PHONE! This plan through BOOST INFINITE also gives me a new phone EVERY YEAR! I have no regrets whatsoever. Even at current deals it's a bargain.

Broken Baseband",11/6/2024,"I purchased an iPhone 15 pro max 256 GB blue titanium. When I tried activating it the wait was so long, I was told something was wrong with the device. After hours of storing and updating, i was getting the same message. I did some research that showed that the device has a broken baseband which shows the error in the picture i took. A broken baseband renders the device useless.Very disappointed."
